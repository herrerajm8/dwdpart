		<h2>About DWD</h2>
		<div>The Dalaguete Water District was formerly under the administration of the local government unit of Dalaguete.  However, by virtue of P.D. 198. Otherwise known as the “ Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973” which was promulgated by the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the DWD became a separate entity, independent of the Municipality of Dalaguete.  Hence, the Municipality of Dalaguete in its regular session on April 28, 1989, adopted and approved the resolution that affirmed the transfer of all existing facilities, namely, the entire Dalaguete Municipal Waterworks System to the jurisdiction and ownership of the Dalaguete Water District. 
<br><br>
		Dalaguete Water District (DWD) is a government-owned and controlled corporation created and existing by virtue of P.D. 198 as amended.  A Certificate of Conformance, Certificate No. 436, dated April 19, 1990 was issued by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) to DWD validating its operations as one of the water districts of the country.<br><br>
		</div>
		<div  id="aboutdwdwcontent" class="collapse">
		As with other water districts, the primary objective of Dalaguete Water District is to provide sufficient potable water to the residents of the town of Dalaguete utilizing available sources of water and applying appropriate water treatment measures to ensure that water is safe for the consumption of its concessionaires.
<br><br>
		The power of the water district is exercised by its Board of Directors which is composed of five individuals representing five sectors of the municipality, ie. civic, business, education, women, and professional sector. The day to day operation of the water district is under the management of the General Manager Mr. Anthony C. Osorio.

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				The Dingayop Spring was first developed as water source sometime in 1950.Water is conveyed through a 150mm ACP transmission pipelines from the spring source to the 95 cum reservoir, and then flow by gravity to the service area in Poblacion. When the water district was formed in 1990, the original water system was turned over by the LGU to the Dalaguete Water District.
<br><br>
				A year after the WD formation, a major rehabilitation project was implemented for the water system of Dalaguete. The project is included in the program dubbed as Belgian Grant Five Towns Water Supply Project. It was a joint undertaking by the government of Belgium, the LWUA, and the provincial government of Cebu. Its purpose is to develop adequate and potable water system for the five pre-selected municipalities in Cebu that includes Borbon, Carmen, Carcar, Pinamungajan and Dalaguete.
<br><br>
				The Belgian government provided the pipe materials, while the Province of Cebu provided grant financial assistance and LWUA provided the engineering study and construction supervision.
</p>
				<p id="bgsecond" class="collapse">
				The Dalaguete project which was completed in 1991 includes laying of about 7.5
				kms of transmission pipelines from Dingayop Spring to the reservoir, installation of
				about 17 km of new distribution pipelines within Poblacion and to other coastal
				barangays , construction of 130 cum reservoir, and other related works. The design
				year of the said project is Y2000.
				<br><br>
				From Y1991 to present, the WD has developed additional water sources to
				augment the water supply to Poblacion and extend the water service to the adjoining
				barangays. This include the well development in Cambangyao, Obong 1, Obong 2 and
				Lumbang.
				<br><br>
				Likewise, other barangay water system from remote barangay of Langkas,
				Caliongan, and Joloymanon were turned-over to the water district thus expanding the
				service to the mountain barangays.
